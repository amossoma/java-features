# Java 10 features


## Local Variable Type Inference
```
    var name = "John"
    var index = 1
    var users = List.of("John", "Mike")
```
[Example 1](https://github.com/amossoma/java-features/blob/java-10/src/main/java/Example1.java)

## Unmodifiable Collections
```
    List.copyOf
    Set.copyOf
    Map.copyOf
    Collectors.to

```
[Example 2](https://github.com/amossoma/java-features/blob/java-10/src/main/java/Example2.java)

## Optional*.orElseThrow()
Throws NoSuchElementException if no value is present.
```
    Optional.orElseThrow()
    OptionalDouble.orElseThrow()
    OptionalInt.orElseThrow()
    OptionalLong.orElseThrow()
```
[Example 3](https://github.com/amossoma/java-features/blob/java-10/src/main/java/Example3.java)

## Performance Improvements

* Parallel Full GC for G1
* Application Class-Data Sharing (AppCDS) _,,allows a set of classes to be pre-processed into a shared archive file that can then be memory-mapped at runtime to reduce startup time which can also reduce dynamic memory footprint when multiple JVMs share the same archive file''_. AppCDS was a commercial feature in Oracle JDK for JDK 8 and JDK 9.
* Experimental Java-Based JIT Compiler

## Container Awareness (_linux only_)
JVMs are now aware of being run in a Docker container. Java flags:
```
    -XX:-UseContainerSupport
    -XX:ActiveProcessorCount
    -XX:InitialRAMPercentage
    -XX:MaxRAMPercentage
    -XX:MinRAMPercentage
``` 

## Root Certificates
Oracle has open-sourced the root certificates in Oracleâ€™s Java SE Root CA program in order to make OpenJDK builds more attractive to developers and to reduce the differences between those builds and Oracle JDK builds.

## Deprecations 
* java.security.acl
* java.security.Certificate
* java.security.Identity
* java.security.IdentityScope
* java.security.Signer

## Removals
* _javah_ tool -> _javac -h_
* _policytool_ tool
* _-Xprof_ java option

## Time-Based Release Versioning
Oracle has moved to the time-based release of Java:

* A new Java release every six months. The March 2018 release is JDK 10, the September 2018 release is JDK 11, ...
* Support for the feature release will last only for six months, i.e., until next feature release
* Long-term support release will be marked as LTS. Support for such release will be for three years
* Java 11 will be an LTS release
